# Plan Progress: Conversational Flow Editor

This document summarizes the implementation progress for the conversational flow editor, following the node-based architecture outlined in `plan.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Restructure & Read-Only Graph View

**Status:** Complete

**Objective:** To refactor the initial list-based UI into a component-based, graph editor foundation and render a read-only version of the flows.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Dependency Added:** The `@vue-flow/core` library was integrated into the project to provide the core functionality for the node-based editor.

2.  **Type Definitions Updated:** The interfaces within `composables/useFlowStepTemplate.ts` were updated to include the `conditional_next_steps` field, ensuring the frontend's data model matches the API's branching capabilities.

3.  **Component Refactoring:** The UI was broken down into more manageable components:
    -   `components/FlowTemplateList.vue`: Now handles all logic for fetching, displaying, and managing the list of flow templates.
    -   `components/FlowEditor.vue`: Created to serve as the primary container for the Vue Flow canvas and all its associated logic.
    -   `pages/flows.vue`: Simplified to act as a layout manager, orchestrating the interaction between the `FlowTemplateList` and `FlowEditor` components.

4.  **Read-Only Graph Implemented:** Initial data transformation logic was created within `FlowEditor.vue`. This logic successfully fetches flow steps from the API and converts them into the `nodes` and `edges` arrays required by Vue Flow, rendering a visual (but non-interactive) graph on the canvas.

## Phase 2: Step (Node) Management

**Status:** Complete

**Objective:** To enable the creation, updating, and deletion of steps (nodes) directly on the canvas.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Custom Node Component (`components/FlowStepNode.vue`):** A custom Vue component was built to define the appearance of each node. It displays the step name, message body, and includes interactive buttons for actions like deletion.

2.  **Step Dialog Component (`components/FlowStepDialog.vue`):** A reusable modal form was created to handle both the creation of new steps and the editing of existing ones, ensuring a consistent user experience.

3.  **CRUD Logic Integration:**
    -   **Create:** The "Add Step" button in the editor is now functional. It opens the `FlowStepDialog`, and upon saving, calls the `useCreateFlowStepTemplate` composable and refreshes the graph.
    -   **Update:** Double-clicking any node on the canvas opens the `FlowStepDialog` pre-filled with that step's data. Saving calls the `useUpdateFlowStepTemplate` composable.
    -   **Delete:** A delete button on each custom node emits an event that is handled by the `FlowEditor`. This triggers a confirmation dialog and, if approved, calls the `useDeleteFlowStepTemplate` composable to remove the step.

## Phase 3: Branching (Connection) Management

**Status:** Complete

**Objective:** To implement the core feature of the editor: allowing users to visually define the flow's branching logic by creating and deleting connections between steps.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Edge Creation:**
    -   The `onConnect` event from Vue Flow is now handled. When a user drags a connection between two nodes, a dialog appears.
    -   This dialog prompts the user to define the condition (e.g., "yes", "no", "*") for the new branch.
    -   Upon saving, the `conditional_next_steps` object of the source node is updated, and the change is persisted to the backend via the `useUpdateFlowStepTemplate` composable.

2.  **Edge Deletion:**
    -   A custom delete button (`Ã—`) has been added to each connection/edge on the canvas.
    -   Clicking this button triggers a confirmation dialog.
    -   If the user confirms, the corresponding condition is removed from the source node's `conditional_next_steps` object, and the change is saved.

## Conclusion

The core implementation of the visual flow editor is complete. The system now supports the creation and management of complex, branching conversational flows through an intuitive, graph-based interface. The final planned task, the hotel configuration page, can now be addressed.
